title: Kubernetes Services Exposed Externally (LoadBalancer/NodePort)
type: query
primary_table: k8_service
description: Finds services of type LoadBalancer or NodePort, which expose applications externally to the cluster. While necessary for external access, these should be reviewed to ensure only intended services are exposed.
metadata:
  reasoning: Services of type LoadBalancer provision an external cloud load balancer, and NodePort services open a specific port on all cluster nodes. Both methods expose the service outside the cluster's internal network, increasing the attack surface. Unintended external exposure can lead to unauthorized access or attacks.
  value: Ensure only necessary services are exposed externally, minimizing the cluster's attack surface and reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
